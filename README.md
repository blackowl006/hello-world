# hello-world
window to the new world
Hi Sapien!

Get prepare myself for this exciting time.
I truly believe we should live to our fullest no matter what happens.

Today, I am adding a few more lines in this file.
Yesterday is history and Tomorrow is an unknown but we only live in the present.

Change space to 4.  What does it mean?
Also, what is Soft wrap?  It's a linewrap mode.
	print('Hello World')
    print('Hell World')
